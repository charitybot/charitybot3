Third iteration of a real time feedback system for Charity Livestreams

## History

Charitybot began as a project to enable livestreamers to have realtime updating overlays for Charity streams.
Since then it has evolved from a quick script to scrape donation amounts and post messages in a twitch chat whenever a donation was detected, to a fullly fledged system where the donations are retrieved from third party fundraising website APIs, stored in a database and served from an API, allowing the building of a web interface to allow streamers to see, in real time various statistics about their stream as well as external systems to make use of the data retrieved.

## Plan

Charitybot was my (Simon, @purrcat259)'s pet project. I started it at the very beginning of my studies and was still working on it three years later after three years of undergrad, two internships and six months of full time work. As a result, it became my test bed for attempting to understand new and exciting ideas such as micro-services or End to End testing. This left the whole codebase in a barely functional state, something I definitely could not maintain very well.

As a result, I have opened a new repository, christening it _charitybot3_. I hope to slowly rewrite and rejuvinate the project, bringing free and high quality automated overlays for any charity livestream, regardless of third party fundraiser used.
